### A. Base Network
DETROIT (DatasET fRom Open Image daTaset):
DETROIT is a re-annotated dataset from [Open Image Dataset (OID) V4](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download_v4.html). You can download corredponding images according to the url in each annotation file.

DOC (Dataset frOm Cars):
DOC combines the annotations of vehicles in [Cars](http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html) with the annotations of lincese plates in [License plate detection and recognition in unconstrained scenarios](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~crjung/alpr-datasets/). You can download corredponding images according to the name of each annotation file, and they have the same name with images in the trainning set of [Cars](http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html).
